# Set

A set is a built-in data structure in Python and is classified as a type of [sequence data structure](sequence.md).

## Characteristics

1. [Mutable Sequence](sequence.md#mutable-x-immutable)
1. [Container Sequence](sequence.md#container-x-flat)
1. `Eliminate all duplicates`
1. Unordered
1. Support mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference
1. Use braces  {}
1. Implemented using a hash table, a property also applicable to FrozenSets.
1. Membership testing is very efficient

## Creating a set

Utilizing literal set syntax such as `{1, 2, 3} is not only quicker but also enhances readability` compared to employing the constructor like set([1, 2, 3]). The constructor approach is slower due to the need for Python to search for the set's constructor, compile a list, and subsequently pass it to the constructor.

```pycon exec="1" source="console" title="creating_set.py"
>>> s = {1}
>>> print(f"using {{}} to create: {type(s)}")
>>> print(s)
>>> print(s.pop())
>>> print(s)
>>> g = set([1, 2, 3])
>>> print(f"using {{}} to create: {type(g)}")
>>> print(g)
>>> print(g.pop())
>>> print(g)
```

## Set Comprehensions (setcomps)

```pycon exec="1" source="console" title="setcomps.py"
>>> from unicodedata import name
>>> setcomp = {chr(i) for i in range(32, 256) if 'SIGN' in name(chr(i),'')}
>>> print(type(setcomp))
>>> print(setcomp)
```

## Elements Must Be Hashable

`Elements within a set must be hashable objects`, complete with appropriate implementations of `__hash__` and `__eq__` methods. It's important to note that the `set type itself isn't hashable`, preventing the construction of sets with nested set instances. However, [FrozenSet](#frozenset) is hashable, allowing for the inclusion of frozenset elements within a set.

## FrozenSet

`A FrozenSet is an immutable variation of a set`. Unlike sets, there is no distinct syntax to denote frozenset literals. Instead, they are generated by invoking the constructor.

```pycon exec="1" source="console" title="frozen_set.py"
>>> my_frozen = frozenset(range(10))
>>> print(type(my_frozen))
>>> print(my_frozen)
```

## Set Operations

### Infix Operators

```pycon exec="1" source="console" title="frozen_set.py"
>>> a = {1, 2, 3 }
>>> b = {3, 4, 5 }
>>> print(f"UNION of A and B: {a | b}")
>>> print(f"INTERSECTION of A and B: {a & b}")
>>> print(f"DIFFERENCE of A and B: {a - b}")
>>> print(f"SYMMETRIC DIFFERENCE of A and B: {a ^ b}")
```
